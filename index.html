        <p>
          Damian was assigned to my Airborne Infantry Battalion Headquarters Company as the company operations sergeant. During the time that Damian was assigned to my company, in garrison, during field training exercises, and on a deployment to Afghanistan conducting combat operations, I found him to be an engaged and dedicated leader who lived by the seven Army values. He was a caring Noncommissioned Officer and who always placed the needs of his Paratroopers, the organization, and the Army, before his own. His combination of intelligence, motivation, candor, focused work ethic, technical and tactical knowledge of infantry company and platoon operations, and incredible level of physical fitness and stamina, resulted in him standing head and shoulders above his peers. He contributed very directly to the overall success of the company on a daily basis.

          Damian was a pleasure to work with! He and I worked on multiple corporate level projects and assignments during our year together. His expansive knowledge of tech and security enabled him to effectively lead our team through vast problem sets with limited oversight. His quick implementation of strategic tech and security processes made him truly stand out from others on our team. I know Damian will be an asset to any team he joins and I would be honored to work with him in the future.
